  Frequently asked questions

#### **Q: What's with the name?**

A: `kpt` was inspired by `apt`, but with a Kubernetes focus. We wanted to
uphold the tradition of naming tools to start with `k`, and also be short
enough that you don't have to alias it. It is pronounced "kept".

#### **Q: What does kpt provide that git clone doesn't**

A: `kpt` enables out-of-the-box workflows that `git clone` does not such as:
cloning and versioning git subdirectories, updating from upstream by
performing structured merges on resources, programmatically editing
configuration (rather than with an editor), etc

#### **Q: How is `kpt` different from other solutions?**

A: Rather than expressing configuration as code, `kpt` represents configuration
packages as data, in particular as YAML or JSON objects adhering to the
[kubernetes resource model]

#### **Q: Why resource configuration as the artifact rather than templates or configuration DSLs?**

A: As explained in [Declarative application management in Kubernetes],
using resource configuration provides a number of desirable properties:

1. it clearly **represents the intended state** of the infrastructure -- no for
   loops, http calls, etc to interpret

2. it **aligns with how tools developed by the Kubernetes project are written**
   -- `kubectl`, `kustomize`, etc

3. it enables **composition of different types of tools written in different languages**

   - any modern language can manipulate YAML / JSON structures, no need to
     adopt `go`

4. it **supports static analysis and validation**

   - develop tools and processes to perform validation and linting

5. it **supports programmatic modification**

   - develop CLIs and UIs for working with configuration rather than using
     `vim`

6. it **supports customizing generated resources** so the templates don't need
   to be modified

   - artifacts generated from templates or DSLs may be modified directly, and
     then merged when they are regenerated to keep the modifications.

7. it **supports display in UI and tools** which use either OpenAPI or the
   YAML/JSON directly.

#### **Q: Isn't writing YAML hard?**

A: `kpt` offers a collection of utilities which enable working with
configuration programmatically to simplify the experience. Using `vi` to edit
YAML should be necessary only for bootstrapping, and the common cases should
use [setters] or [functions] to generate or modify YAML configuration.

#### **Q: I really like DSL / templating solution X. Can I use it with `kpt`?**

A: Yes. `kpt` supports plugging in solutions which generate or manipulate
configuration, e.g. from DSLs and templates. This may be performed using
[source functions] from our catalog. The generated output may be modified
directly, and merged when regenerated.

#### **Q: I want to write high-level abstractions like CRDs, but on the client-side. Can I do this with `kpt`?**

A: Yes. `kpt`'s architecture facilitates developing programs which may
generate or modify configuration. See the [Functions User Guide] for how to
compose multiple programs together.

#### **Q: How do I roll out changes throughout my organization using `kpt`?**

A: This can be done one of several ways, including: 1) using semantic
versioning or release channels with [functions], or 2) [updating] packages.

#### **Q: Is there a container image that contains kpt?**

A: Yes. [gcr.io/kpt-dev/kpt] contains the `kpt` binary.

#### **Q: How do I run source or sink functions?**

A: All kpt functions, including source and sink functions, should be run using
`kpt fn run`. The `kpt fn source` and `kpt fn sink` commands run builtin source
and sink functions.

#### **Q: I still have questions. How do I contact you?**

A: [Please reach out!][contact]

### Next Steps

- Learn about kpt [architecture] including major influences and a high-level
  comparison with kustomize.
- Consult the [command reference] for how to use kpt.
- Read kpt [guides] for how to produce and consume packages and integrate with
  a wider ecosystem of tools.
