<!--mdtogo:Short
    Locally execute one or more functions in containers
-->

Generate, transform, or validate configuration files using locally run
functions.

Functions are packaged as container images, starlark scripts, or binary
executables which are run against the contents of a package.

Get an overview on how to use `kpt fn run` from the [Running Functions] guide.

This page dives into details of the `kpt fn run` command flow and serves as a
reference for advanced usecases.

## Synopsis

<!--mdtogo:Long-->

```sh
kpt fn run [DIR] [flags]
```

If the container exits with non-zero status code, run will fail and print the
container `STDERR`.

```sh
DIR:
  Path to a package directory.  Defaults to stdin if unspecified.
```

<!--mdtogo-->

## Examples

<!--mdtogo:Examples-->

```sh
# read the Resources from DIR, provide them to a container my-fun as input,
# write my-fn output back to DIR
kpt fn run DIR/ --image gcr.io/example.com/my-fn
```

```sh
# provide the my-fn with an input ConfigMap containing `data: {foo: bar}`
kpt fn run DIR/ --image gcr.io/example.com/my-fn:v1.0.0 -- foo=bar
```

```sh
# run the functions in FUNCTIONS_DIR against the Resources in DIR
kpt fn run DIR/ --fn-path FUNCTIONS_DIR/
```

```sh
# discover functions in DIR and run them against Resource in DIR.
# functions may be scoped to a subset of Resources -- see `kpt help fn run`
kpt fn run DIR/
```

```sh
# pipe a resource from stdin and execute a function against it.
# print the results to stdout
kpt fn source . | kpt fn run --image gcr.io/example.com/my-fn
```

<!--mdtogo-->

## Structured Results

Functions may emit results using the structure defined in the
[typescript result] interface as an alternative to exiting with a non-zero
status code. Users may want to store these results separately from
configuration files. Kpt provides the `--results-dir` flag for users to
specify a destination to write results to.

**Example**: Run `validate-rolebinding` on an example package

```sh
kpt pkg get https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt-functions-sdk.git/example-configs example-configs
mkdir results/
kpt fn run example-configs/ --results-dir results/ --image gcr.io/kpt-functions/validate-rolebinding:results -- subject_name=bob@foo-corp.com
```

## Network Access

By default, container functions cannot access network. `kpt` may enable network
access using the `--network` flag, and specifying that a network is required in
the functionConfig.

**Example**: Run `kubeval` on a package

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config
  annotations:
    config.k8s.io/function: |
      container:
        image: gcr.io/kpt-functions/kubeval
        network: true
    config.kubernetes.io/local-config: 'true'
```

```sh
kpt pkg get https://github.com/instrumenta/kubeval.git/fixtures .
kpt fn source fixtures/*invalid.yaml |
  kpt fn run --fn-path fc.yaml --network 2>error.txt || true
```

## Mounting Directories

By default, container functions cannot access the local file system. `kpt` may
enable functions to mount volumes using the `--mount` flag passing the same
arguments as for `docker run`.

**Example**: Run `kustomize-build` on a helloWorld package

```sh
kpt pkg get https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/examples/helloWorld helloWorld
kpt fn source helloWorld |
  kpt fn run --mount type=bind,src="$(pwd)/helloWorld",dst=/source --image gcr.io/kpt-functions/kustomize-build -- path=/source |
  kpt fn sink .
```

All volumes are mounted readonly by default. Specify `rw=true` to mount volumes
in read-write mode.

```sh
kpt pkg get https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/examples/helloWorld helloWorld
kpt fn source helloWorld |
  kpt fn run --mount type=bind,src="$(pwd)/helloWorld",dst=/source,rw=true --image gcr.io/kpt-functions/kustomize-build -- path=/source |
  kpt fn sink .
```

`kpt` accepts the same options to `--mount` specified on the [Docker Volumes]
page.

Depending on the container image, the configuration function may not have
permissions to access mounted volumes. Check how the function is running inside
the container in case of permissions issues.

## Environment Variables

`kpt` will not export any local environment variables by default when launching a
Docker container. You can explicitly specify the environment variables that you
want to export by either declarative or imperative ways. The value can be in
`key=value` format or only the key of an already exported environment variable.

Declarative Example:

Use an `env` field in the function config file.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: build
  annotations:
    config.kubernetes.io/local-config: 'true'
    config.kubernetes.io/function: |
      container:
        image: gcr.io/kpt-functions/kustomize-build
        env: [foo=bar, KUBECONFIG]
```

Imperative Example:

Use `--env` or `-e` flag.

```bash
kpt fn run --image whatever --env KUBECONFIG -e foo=bar
```

If both declarative and imperative ways are used, the imperative values will be
merged with declarative values.

* Different keys will be both added to the env list.
* Same key but different values: declarative value will be replaced by
 imperative value.

## Deferring Failure

When running multiple validation functions, it may be desired to defer failures
until all functions have been run so that the results of all functions are
written to the results directory. Functions can specify that failures should be
deferred by specifying `deferFailure` in the declaration.

```yaml
apiVersion: example.com/v1alpha1
kind: ExampleFunction
metadata:
  annotations:
    config.kubernetes.io/local-config: 'true'
    config.kubernetes.io/function: |
      container:
        image: gcr.io/example.com/image:v1.0.0
      # continue running functions if this fails, and fail at the end
      deferFailure: true
```

## Scoping Rules

Functions which are nested under some sub directory are scoped only to
Resources under that same sub directory. This allows fine grain control over
how functions are executed.

`kpt fn run DIR/` will recursively traverse DIR/ looking for declared functions
and invoking them -- passing in only those resources scoped to the function.

**Example:** Function declared in `stuff/my-function.yaml` is scoped to
Resources in `stuff/` and is NOT scoped to Resources in `apps/`

```sh
.
├── stuff
│   ├── inscope-deployment.yaml
│   ├── stuff2
│   │     └── inscope-deployment.yaml
│   └── my-function.yaml # functions is scoped to stuff/...
└── apps
    ├── not-inscope-deployment.yaml
    └── not-inscope-service.yaml
```

Alternatively, you can also place function configurations in a special
directory named `functions`.

**Example**: This is equivalent to previous example

```sh
.
├── stuff
│   ├── inscope-deployment.yaml
│   ├── stuff2
│   │     └── inscope-deployment.yaml
│   └── functions
│         └── my-function.yaml
└── apps
    ├── not-inscope-deployment.yaml
    └── not-inscope-service.yaml
```

Alternatively, you can also use `--fn-path` to explicitly provide the directory
containing function configurations:

```sh
kpt fn run DIR/ --fn-path FUNCTIONS_DIR/
```

Alternatively, scoping can be disabled using `--global-scope` flag. Using `--fn-flag`
or `--image` will not enable global scope automatically.

## Imperative Run Specifics

### Generating FunctionConfig for Imperative Runs

When functions are run imperatively, the functionConfig will be generated from
command line arguments.

When functions are run using the below command, the key-value pairs following
`--` are parsed into a ConfigMap which is set as the functionConfig. The
arguments are passed as `data` elements in the ConfigMap.

**Example**: Run `validate-rolebinding` on an example package

```sh
kpt pkg get https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt-functions-sdk.git/example-configs example-configs
mkdir results/
kpt fn run example-configs/ --results-dir results/ --image gcr.io/kpt-functions/validate-rolebinding:results -- subject_name=bob@foo-corp.com
```

Function Input:

```yaml
kind: ResourceList
functionConfig:
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  data:
    subject_name: bob@foo-corp.com
    ...
items:
  ...
```

If the first argument after `--` is _not_ a key=value pair, it will be used as
the functionConfig type.

Run the function:

```sh
kpt fn run DIR/ --image foo:v1 -- Foo a=b c=d
```

Function Input:

```yaml
kind: ResourceList
functionConfig:
  kind: Foo
  data:
    a: b
    c: d
    ...
items:
  ...
```

### Caveats to Running Imperatively

kpt does not handle imperatively running functions which use the following
types of arguments.

#### Complex arguments

Functions may take complex arguements such as lists and maps that have nested
fields. It's recommended to run such functions declaratively.

#### Arguments interpreted as flags

Some functions like `helm-template`, `istioctl-analyze`, and `kustomize-build`
take arbitrary command line flags as arguments. Passing arguments such as
`--use-kube=false` imperatively results in parsing issues. See more details in
the following:

* [Issue 823]
* [Issue 824]

When passing flags as arguments, it's recommended to run functions
declaratively.

#### Functions expecting spec field

`kpt fn run` provides any arguments passed imperatively to the container image
in a `ConfigMap` containing a `data` field. Some config functions may expect
arguemnts passed in a `spec` field instead. It's recommended to run such
functions declaratively by passing a `ConfigMap` with a `spec` field. See more
details in the following:

* [Issue 757]

## Declarative Run Specifics

### Multiple Functions Ordering

Functions execution follows a deterministic order and is based on the following set of rules:

* If the functions are specified in the same file
(multi-object YAML file separated by `---`), they will
be executed sequentially in the order that they are specified.
* If the functions are specified in multiple files,
the functions deeper in the file system tree are executed first.
* If the functions are specified in multiple files but are at same file
system tree depth, the function in the file
with shorter lexical file path is executed first.

**Example:** Directory structure with multiple functions and corresponding ordering

```sh
.
├── stuff
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── stuff2
│   │     └── deployment.yaml
│   │     └── my-function3.yaml # executed first
└── └── my-function1.yaml # executed second
    └── my-function2.yaml # executed third
```

### Custom `functionConfig`

Functions may define their own API input types - these may be client-side
equivalents of CRDs:

**Example**: Declare two functions in `DIR/functions/my-functions.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  annotations:
    config.kubernetes.io/local-config: 'true'
    config.kubernetes.io/function: |
      container:
        image: gcr.io/example.com/my-fn
data:
  foo: bar
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: MyType
metadata:
  annotations:
    config.kubernetes.io/local-config: 'true'
    config.kubernetes.io/function: |
      container:
        image: gcr.io/example.com/other-fn
spec:
  field:
    nestedField: value
  --flag-arg: flag-value
```

Because the first function uses the default `ConfigMap` kind with arguments as
key-value pairs in the `data` field, kpt is able to run it both imperatively
and declaratively. kpt is only able to run the second function declaratively
because:

* it expects arguments in the `spec` field
* it takes complex arguments with nested values
* it takes flags as arguments

### Don't use Imperative and Declarative in One Command

If you use imperative functions (by `--image` or `--fn-path`) with declarative
ones (by config files in `DIR`, see following section) at the same time, the
declarative functions will be **ignored**.
